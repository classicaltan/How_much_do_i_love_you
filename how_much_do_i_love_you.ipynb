    "My friend, let's call her Cassandra, have known each other since secondary school. We are now navigating the joys of adulthood together. We have a warm friendship based on mutual trust, and similar interests including fiber arts and academia. I find Cassandra fascinating, because I think that her brain is the perfect mix of the analytical and creative. We are both in happy, settled relationships. Recently, Cassandra has been helping me with my professional development. \n",

    "\n",
    "The first few stages of this process I have chosen to describe, rather than show, to preserve anonymity. Although Cassandra has given me her permission to use her data, I have taken this step to protect Casandra's right to be annonymous on the internet and more importantly, to keep potentially sensitive data safe. This is how I gathered the data:\n",
    "\n",
    ">1. I exported our conversation as a .txt file to my google drive.\n",
    ">2. I then imported it into excel. This part was a little tricky, because my data has a lot of 'creative' punctuation, and cannot be seperated by coloumns automatically (e.g. ?:: are all used within message data, as well as to denote date and time). I have chosen to do this manually.\n",
    ">3. I then replaced names and addresses with excel's 'find and replace' function. Why the name Casandra? Because in the Greek myths, Cassandra is a prophetess who is not believed. Therefore, she finds herself without a voice. A little bit like the role our Cassandra will have in this dataset; voiced, and yet voiceless. Other names and addresses have also been changed to preserve anonymity.\n",
    ">4. Then I used the excel function TRIM to seperate the columns into date, time, and message.\n",
    ">5. I had to think carefully about how to utillise empty fields. You see, whatsapp has a function where you can 'reference' an earlier message by swiping it, and replying to that particular message. In my dataset, this shows up as an empty field.\n",
    ">6. I saved the workbook as a .csv file."
