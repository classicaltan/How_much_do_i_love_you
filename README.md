How Much Do I Love You?

About

My friend, let's call her Cassandra, have known each other since secondary school. We are now navigating the joys of adulthood together. We have a warm friendship based on mutual trust, and similar interests including fiber arts and academia. I find Cassandra fascinating, because I think that her brain is the perfect mix of the analytical and creative. We are both in happy, settled relationships. Recently, Cassandra has been helping me with my professional development.

Enter Whatsapp messaging. We have had a chat on Whatsapp since March 2017. I have decided to carry out an analysis of our chats over the years to answer some social questions.

What time of day, week, and, year do me and Cassandra chat the most?
